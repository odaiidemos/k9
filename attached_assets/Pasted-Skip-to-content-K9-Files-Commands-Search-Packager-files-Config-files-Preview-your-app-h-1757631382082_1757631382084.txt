Create system data structure
2 / 8
Successfully imported from Replit
Integrating with Flask Website

Installed flask, flask-sqlalchemy, psycopg2, email_validator, gunicorn
I'll explore the codebase and set it up to run in the Replit environment. Let me start by understanding the project structure and checking what's already there.

Opened home directory

Opened replit.md
Let me explore the key files to understand the project setup better, particularly the main application files and configuration.


Opened config.py

Opened pyproject.toml
Now let me check the current workflow status and examine what dependencies we need, then create the necessary environment setup:

Checked system logs

Agent ran into an error
Based on the expert feedback, let me search the Replit documentation for information about provisioning PostgreSQL databases:


Searched Replit documentation for "How to create PostgreSQL database in Replit workspace"
Let me check the database status and install the necessary dependencies first:

Now I need to install the dependencies and set up the database. Let me create a task list to organize this import process:

Created task list
Let me start by installing the required dependencies using uv. First, I'll install the dependencies and then proceed with setting up the database:


Executed uv sync
Good! The dependencies are now installed. Now let me create a PostgreSQL database. Since the direct tool failed, I should use Replit's integration system:


Searched Replit's integrations for "PostgreSQL database"
Integrating with PostgreSQL database
Great! The PostgreSQL integration was successfully added, although the direct database creation had a permission issue. Let me check if we have a database now:

The database is not yet provisioned. Let me try to check if there are environment variables available first, and then proceed with setting up the database manually:


Executed env | grep -E "(DATABASE|PGHOST|PGPORT|PGUSER|PGPASSWORD|PGDATABASE)" | head -10
Excellent! I can see that the database environment variables are already available. Now let me update my task list and proceed with running database migrations to set up the schema:


Add necessary program tools

Set up data storage for system
Now let me run the database migrations to set up the database schema. I'll need to initialize the migration repository first and then apply the migrations:


Executed cd /home/runner/$(basename "$REPL_SLUG") && uv run flask db init
I need to set the SESSION_SECRET environment variable first. Let me check how it's set in the workflow:


Executed export SESSION_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" && echo "SESSION_SECRET set successfully"
Let me examine the existing migrations directory to understand what migrations already exist:

Opened migrations directory

Opened migrations/alembic.ini
I can see that migrations already exist. Let me try to run the existing migrations with the proper environment variable:


Executed export SESSION_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" && cd /home/runner/$(basename "$REPL_SLUG") && uv run flask db upgrade
There seems to be an issue with the process. Let me try a different approach and check the current status more thoroughly:


Executed export SESSION_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" && uv run python -c "from app import app, db; print('App loaded successfully')"
Working..
